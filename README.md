## Overview
Water quality data indicates that there is a long-term trend of increasing concentrations of Total dissolved solids (TDS) in NJ's freshwater streams.

[NJDEP's billenial water quality assessment](https://www.state.nj.us/dep/wms/bears/assessment.htm)  found that 26 HUC14 subwatersheds are impaired by TDS concentrations over the [surface water quality standard](https://www.state.nj.us/dep/wms/bears/swqs.htm) of 500 mg/L. 
The primary cause is winter application of road salts.
